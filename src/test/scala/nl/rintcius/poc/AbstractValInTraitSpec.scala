   * Example code for this blog post:

   *
   * **Hypotheses:**
   *
   * 1. It is always ok to declare abstract values in traits. (marked as OK in the code)
   * 2. Avoid code that uses abstract values in traits during the initialization phase (marked as NOT OK in the code).
   * 3. After the trait is initialized it is ok to use abstract values.
   *
   * Furthermore, code that "patches" code which is NOT OK is also marked.
   *
   * Counter arguments & Refinements welcome (with evidence)!
